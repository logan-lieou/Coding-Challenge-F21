## NLTK Solution

The pretrained model thinks `{'neg': 0.065, 'neu': 0.748, 'pos': 0.187, 'compound': 0.9982}`
what does this mean? It's 6% confident that the input.txt file is neg 18% confident that it's positive
and 74% sure that it's nuetral, with a compound confidence of 99% meaning there's a 1% margin of error

overall the model seems to belive that the text is mostly nuetral
