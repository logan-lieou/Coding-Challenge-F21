### Sentiment Analysis

Yeah so it seems the document is overall neutral it depends on how we sample the text but it seems to be within the margin of error of our confidence
meaning +-5% of nuetral. Sometimes the model predicts the text to be slightly positive other times it predicts it to be slightly negitive I'm going 
to have to do some statistics and this will go in the final paper I think

### The Prediction

closer to 1 = positive closer to 0 = negitive closer to 0.5 = nuetral
